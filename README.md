# Hai - Hoani's AI tool

At the moment this is basically just a simplified terminal UI of chatgpt. 

Benefits:
* Using an OpenAI API token is cheaper than paying a ChatGPT subscription
* No more "our servers are busy" nonsense

## Installation

```
go install github.com/hoani/hai
```

## Setup

```
hai init
```

This will ask for your openai API key. You will need an openai account and add a key here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

## Chat

```
hai chat
```
